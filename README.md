# Frontend UI Challenge

### Task

Build the frontend UI of a drink site.

The home page should display a list of drink categories. Clicking on a category should navigate to a page that shows a list of drinks in that category.

The category page should use the images that are returned by the API.

### Overview

The pages you need to edit are all located in the `/src/pages/` directory. The `index.jsx` file contains the home page. The `category.jsx` file contains the category page.

### Styling

Feel free to design the pages however you want. The main focus is on the layout of the page. If you have extra time, you can work on making the pages look nice.
